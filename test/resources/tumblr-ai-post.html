<p name="2ebb" id="2ebb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There is something similar about driving and testing. While testing is an exercise in creativity, parts of it
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">are</em> boring — just like driving is. Regression testing is tedious in that you need to do the same tests over and over
  again, every time a release is created, just like your daily commute. And just like during your daily commute, doing something
  repetitively is a recipe for mistakes, so repetitive testing, just like driving, is a
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dangerous </em>activity, as can be seen from the various crash sites strewn over our commute highways. Or by the various
  bugs that slipped from us during our regression testing.</p>
<p name="446d" id="446d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is why we automate testing. We write code that runs our tests, and run them whenever we want. But even
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">that</em> gets repetitive. Another day, another form field to check. Another form, another page. And one gets the feeling
  that writing those tests is a repetitive process. That it too can be automated.</p>
<p name="5011" id="5011" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Can AI automate this process? Can we make some, or all parts of our testing, and writing our tests, autonomous ? Can AI do
  to writing tests what it is doing to driving?</p>

<p name="65ee" id="65ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What’s the big deal? Why is everybody in a panic to be a player in this market? Why are self-driving cars such a big deal?
  Why are they perceived to be the future of cars? Because everybody “knows” that long-term, nobody is going to be driving
  their own cars. Because, as we said, driving is a boring activity. Everybody would rather teleport to the office than spend
  an hour driving there. And if teleporting is not an option (

    class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">yet</a>!), then a driver that drives you there is almost as good an option. While they are driving, you can get work done,
  catch up with friends, or take a nap. And if the boredom is taken out of the equation, the accidents that come with it
  are taken out too.</p>
<p name="d1f3" id="d1f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of consumer appeal, the possibility of saving billions in insurance money, and because of the possibility that self-driving
  cars will solve the present traffic jams, car manufacturers and hi-tech companies are scrambling to implement this technology.</p>
<p name="5f46" id="5f46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what exactly defines a self-driving autonomous car? Is every autonomous car like another? How is Tesla’s driving-assistance
  similar to Volkswagen’s automatic braking system? And how are they related to Google’s

    class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">classification system for autonomous cars</a>, a classification that was adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety

<p name="b9c0" id="b9c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The classification adopts six levels of driving automation, and a car is classified for a level depending on the amount of
  autonomy it exhibits.</p>
<p name="15ee" id="15ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first level of driving automation is Level 0 — no automation whatsoever. Congratulations! You are already the proud owner
  of an autonomous car, Level 0.</p>
<p name="2f63" id="2f63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 1 is where we are today, in some cars on the road. It is named “Driving Assistance”, and is where things like the modern
  Cruise Control and automatic braking systems are today. In this mode, the human is still under control — the AI is only
  assisting while the human is driving.</p>
<p name="65ae" id="65ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 2 is “Partial Automation”. This is the level Tesla’s Autopilot and GM’s Super Cruise reside in. In this level, the
  human is still in charge, but the AI takes care of the boring details of acceleration/deceleration and steering, while
  assuming that the human can take over on the first problem. We’re talking mostly highways here, and not city driving.</p>
<p name="4afb" id="4afb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 3 is “Conditional Automation”. This is the first level where the car drives itself. But only under certain conditions,
  and always under the assumption that the human can take over when the AI notifies it that it is incapable of responding
  to a certain situation.</p>
<p name="40b0" id="40b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 4 is “High Automation”. In this level, the AI totally takes over all driving, and does not assume that the human can
  take over. In other words, this car can drive without a steering wheel. Google’s cars are at this level. The caveat is
  that there are times and places that the car cannot be autonomous, like in a snow storm, or during fog.</p>
<p name="07c3" id="07c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 5 is the highest level — “Full Automation”. The car can be autonomous anytime and anywhere. We have yet to reach that
  level of automation, but we’re getting there.</p>
<p name="c6ca" id="c6ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 6 is “SkyNet Automation”. No human is even in the car, because the robots have killed all of them! (Just joking — this
  level doesn’t really exist.)</p>
<h3 name="4932" id="4932" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Autonomous Testing</h3>
<p name="3685" id="3685" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So back to autonomous testing. My company, Applitools, has just hired a new guy, an addition to our algorithm and AI team.
  During lunch, we started talking about the similarities between driving and testing, and just brainstorming this idea of
  “levels of autonomous testing”. These are our thoughts on this. </p>
<p name="3e1f" id="3e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank">Caveat Emptor</a>! There is a

    class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">saying in Hebrew</a> that since the destruction of the (second) temple, prophecy is only given to fools and children. So
  please take these levels with a grain of salt. On the other hand, while these thoughts reflect our fantasies, they also
  reflect where we think the testing world is going in terms of using AI.</p>
<p name="5e4f" id="5e4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So fasten your seat belts, we’re going on a ride through the 6 levels of autonomous testing</p>

<p name="3078" id="3078" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Congratulations! You’re there. You write code that tests the application, and you’re very happy because you can run the tests
  again and again on every release, instead of boringly repeating the same tests again and again. This is perfect, because
  now you can concentrate on the
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">important </em>aspects of testing:</p>

</figure>
<p name="4748" id="4748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">But nobody’s helping you write that automation code. And writing the code itself is repetitive. Any field added to a form
  means adding a test. Any form added to a page means adding a test that checks all the fields. And any page added means
  checking all the components and forms in that page.</p>
<p name="981a" id="981a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, the more tests you have, the more they fail when there is a sweeping change in the application. Each and every
  failed test needs to be checked to verify whether this is a
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">real</em> bug, or just a new baseline.</p>
<h3 name="a719" id="a719" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Level 1 — “Drive Assistance”</h3>
<p name="93a5" id="93a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">An interesting thing we saw when we researched autonomous driving, is that
  <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4087480-audi-beats-tesla-gm-level-3-autonomy" data-href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4087480-audi-beats-tesla-gm-level-3-autonomy"
    class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the better the vision system of the autonomous car, the better its autonomy is</a>. This is why we believe the better the
  AI can
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">see</em> the app, the more autonomous it can be. This means that it should be able to see not only a snapshot of the DOM
  of the page, but also a visual picture of the page.</p>
<p name="60f7" id="60f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once the testing framework can
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">see </em>the page, and look at it holistically, whether through the DOM or through a screenshot, it can help you write
  those checks that you write manually. </p>
<p name="d688" id="d688" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we take a screenshot of the page, we can holistically check all form fields and texts in the page in one fell swoop. Instead
  of writing code that checks each and every field, we can test all of them at once against the baseline of the previous
  test.</p>

</figure>
<p name="6462" id="6462" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This level exists today in testing tools like
  <a href="https://www.applitools.com?utm_source=SOF&amp;utm_medium=GT" data-href="https://www.applitools.com?utm_source=SOF&amp;utm_medium=GT"
    class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Applitools Eyes</a>. Previous tools that tried to do this failed because comparing images pixel by pixel never works. For
  it to work, the tool needs AI algorithms to figure out what changes are not really changes and which ones are real.</p>
<p name="ecf8" id="ecf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is how AI
  <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">today</strong> assists you in writing your test code, by writing all your checks for you. The human is still driving the
  tests, but the some of the checks are done automatically by the AI.</p>
<p name="b9a3" id="b9a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, the AI can check that a test passes, but when it fails it still needs to notify the human to check whether the failure
  is a real one, or happened because of a correct change in the software. The human will then have to confirm that the change
  is good, or reject it because it’s a bug.</p>
<p name="2ebc" id="2ebc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And having the AI “see” the application means that the AI can check the
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">visual</em> aspects of an application against a baseline. This is something that until now could
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">only</em> be covered by manual testing.</p>
<p name="d09e" id="d09e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the human still needs to assert every change.</p>
<h4 name="5187" id="5187" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Level 2 — “Partial Automation”</h4>
<p name="6f54" id="6f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">With Level 1 autonomy, the tester can pass on the tedious aspect of writing the checks for all the fields on a page onto
  the AI by having the AI test against a baseline. And the AI can now test the visual aspects of the page.</p>
<p name="6784" id="6784" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But checking each and every test failure to verify whether it’s a “good” failure or a real bug can be tedious, especially
  if one change is reflected in many test failures. A Level 2 AI will assist the human in checking changes against the baseline
  and will turn what used to be a tedious effort into a simple one.</p>
<p name="6710" id="6710" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Level 2 AI will look at the combination of DOM and screenshot to understand which parts of a page are dynamic and change
  based on data in the database or in external services, and which are static and are meant to be visual. Both of these aspects
  of a page, the dynamic and the static, need to be tested, but they need to be tested
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">differently</em> — the dynamic aspects are driven by the business logic, and the static pages are driven by the visual
  design.</p>
<p name="188d" id="188d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the AI can look at lots of snapshots of the same page, it can start to understand which parts of the page are dynamic,
  and which are static and treat them separately. The static parts can and should be understood visually, while the dynamic
  parts mostly need to be checked in terms of data.</p>
<p name="3fca" id="3fca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once the AI can differentiate between the two, the alarms that it gives the human will not be just “this page has changed”,
  but “this data in the page should be the same, but isn’t”, versus “the page’s look has changed”. This will enable the human
  to check software changes more quickly.</p>
<p name="3afc" id="3afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, because it has lots of snapshots of lots of pages, a Level 2 AI will be able to group lots of changes in lots of
  pages, changes that happened due to a correct software change, and tell the human that these are the “same” change, and
  would they like to please confirm or reject all these changes as a group.</p>

<p name="b7e4" id="b7e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In Level 2, any failure or change detected in the software still needs to be vetted by a human. A Level 2 AI can help analyzing
  the change, but cannot understand whether a baseline is correct or not just by looking at the baseline. But a Level 3 AI
  can do that and much more, because it can apply machine learning techniques to both the data aspects of a page, and the
  visual aspects of a page.</p>

  </div>
</figure>
<p name="3265" id="3265" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For example, a Level 3 AI can look at the visual aspects of a page and figure out whether the design is off, based on standard
  rules for design, rules like alignment rules, whitespace use, color and font usage, and layout rules.</p>
<p name="dd25" id="dd25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And what about the data aspects? A Level 3 AI will also be able to look at the data and figure out that all the numbers up
  to now, in this field or that, need to be between a specific range, and that this field is an email, and this one needs
  to be the sum of these fields above it. It can figure out that in this page,
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this</em> table needs to be sorted by
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this </em>column.</p>
<p name="4919" id="4919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So even if there was a change in the page, the AI can still understand that this page is OK, and not submit it to a human
  to vet. And because that AI is looking at hundreds of test results, and seeing how things change
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">over time</em>, it can apply machine learning techniques to detect
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anomalies</em> in the changes, and only submit a test to a human to verify if such an anomaly is detected.</p>
<h3 name="6f3f" id="6f3f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Level 4 — “High Automation”</h3>
<p name="c57d" id="c57d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Up to now, all the AI did was run the
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">checks</em> automatically. The human is still driving the test, and clicking on the links (albeit using automation software).
  Level 4 is where the AI is driving the test itself!</p>
<p name="b28b" id="b28b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Level 4 AI will be able to understand some pages, by understanding what type of page it is. It will understand that this
  page is a login page, this one is a profile page, and that one is a registration page, or a shopping cart page. Once the
  AI understands the type of page, using techniques like reinforcement learning, it can start driving the tests on it automatically,
  without human intervention.</p>
<p name="b33a" id="b33a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But a Level 4 AI will be able to drive tests even on pages that it doesn’t understand, by looking at user interactions over
  time, understanding them, and driving tests through this understanding.</p>
<h3 name="fc81" id="fc81" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Level 5 — “Full Automation”</h3>
<p name="8f8f" id="8f8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This one’s really Scifi, and we’re starting to fly on wings of fantasy. So fly with me: at this level, the AI will be able
  to converse with the product manager, understand the application, and fully drive the tests itself!</p>
<p name="91cd" id="91cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, given that no human tester is capable of talking to a product manager to understand the application, AI-s
  will need to be much smarter than humans to reach this level! 😀</p>
<h3 name="e482" id="e482" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Level 6 — “Skynet Automation”</h3>
<p name="5439" id="5439" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At this level, due to the Robot Apocalypse, no humans are left alive, so there’s nothing to test, is there? Then again, who’s

<p name="3346" id="3346" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most emphatically, no! Software Testing is similar to driving in some aspects, but in other aspects it is much more complicated,
  as it entails understanding complex human interactions. An AI today doesn’t
  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">really</em> understand what it’s doing. It’s just automating tasks based on lots and lots of historical data.
</p>
<p name="6a4c" id="6a4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where are we now in terms of using AI? Advanced tools like

  in the future. This is good news — in the next decade or so, we will be able to enjoy the

  <u>About the Author:</u>
  <br> 30 years of experience have not dulled the fascination Gil Tayar has with software development. From the olden days of
  DOS, to the contemporary world of Software Testing, Gil was, is, and always will be, a software developer. He has in the
  past co-founded WebCollage, survived the bubble collapse of 2000, and worked on various big cloudy projects at Wix.
  <br> His current passion is figuring out how to test software, a passion which he has turned into his main job as Evangelist
  and Senior Architect at Applitools. He has religiously tested all his software, from the early days as a junior software
  developer to the current days at Applitools, where he develops tests for software that tests software, which is almost
  one meta layer too many for him.
  <br> In his private life, he is a dad to two lovely kids (and a cat), an avid reader of Science Fiction, (he counts Samuel
  Delany, Robert Silverberg, and Robert Heinlein as favorites) and a passionate film buff. (Stanley Kubrick, Lars Von Trier,
  David Cronenberg, anybody?)
  <br> Unfortunately for him, he hasn’t really answered the big question of his life - he still doesn't know whether static languages
  or dynamic languages are best.
