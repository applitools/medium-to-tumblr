              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">are</em> boring — just like driving is. Regression testing is tedious in that you need to do the same tests
              over and over again, every time a release is created, just like your daily commute. And just like during your
              daily commute, doing something repetitively is a recipe for mistakes, so repetitive testing, just like driving,
              is a
              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dangerous </em>activity, as can be seen from the various crash sites strewn over our commute highways. Or by
              the various bugs that slipped from us during our regression testing.</p>
            <p name="446d" id="446d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is why we automate testing. We write code that runs our tests, and run them whenever we want. But even
              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">that</em> gets repetitive. Another day, another form field to check. Another form, another page. And one gets
              the feeling that writing those tests is a repetitive process. That it too can be automated.</p>

              Can AI do to writing tests what it is doing to driving?</p>

              a big deal? Why are they perceived to be the future of cars? Because everybody “knows” that long-term, nobody
              is going to be driving their own cars. Because, as we said, driving is a boring activity. Everybody would rather
              teleport to the office than spend an hour driving there. And if teleporting is not an option (

              get work done, catch up with friends, or take a nap. And if the boredom is taken out of the equation, the accidents
              that come with it are taken out too.</p>

                the amount of autonomy it exhibits.</p>
              <p name="15ee" id="15ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first level of driving automation is Level 0 — no automation whatsoever. Congratulations! You are already
                the proud owner of an autonomous car, Level 0.</p>
              <p name="2f63" id="2f63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 1 is where we are today, in some cars on the road. It is named “Driving Assistance”, and is where things
                like the modern Cruise Control and automatic braking systems are today. In this mode, the human is still
                under control — the AI is only assisting while the human is driving.</p>
              <p name="65ae" id="65ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 2 is “Partial Automation”. This is the level Tesla’s Autopilot and GM’s Super Cruise reside in. In this
                level, the human is still in charge, but the AI takes care of the boring details of acceleration/deceleration
                and steering, while assuming that the human can take over on the first problem. We’re talking mostly highways
                here, and not city driving.</p>
              <p name="4afb" id="4afb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 3 is “Conditional Automation”. This is the first level where the car drives itself. But only under certain
                conditions, and always under the assumption that the human can take over when the AI notifies it that it
                is incapable of responding to a certain situation.</p>
              <p name="40b0" id="40b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 4 is “High Automation”. In this level, the AI totally takes over all driving, and does not assume that
                the human can take over. In other words, this car can drive without a steering wheel. Google’s cars are at
                this level. The caveat is that there are times and places that the car cannot be autonomous, like in a snow
                storm, or during fog.</p>
              <p name="07c3" id="07c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 5 is the highest level — “Full Automation”. The car can be autonomous anytime and anywhere. We have yet
                to reach that level of automation, but we’re getting there.</p>
              <p name="c6ca" id="c6ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Level 6 is “SkyNet Automation”. No human is even in the car, because the robots have killed all of them! (Just
                joking — this level doesn’t really exist.)</p>

              <p name="3685" id="3685" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">So back to autonomous testing. My company, Applitools, has just hired a new guy, an addition to our algorithm
                and AI team. During lunch, we started talking about the similarities between driving and testing, and just
                brainstorming this idea of “levels of autonomous testing”. These are our thoughts on this.</p>

              <p name="3078" id="3078" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Congratulations! You’re there. You write code that tests the application, and you’re very happy because you
                can run the tests again and again on every release, instead of boringly repeating the same tests again and
                again. This is perfect, because now you can concentrate on the

                to a form means adding a test. Any form added to a page means adding a test that checks all the fields. And
                any page added means checking all the components and forms in that page.</p>
              <p name="981a" id="981a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, the more tests you have, the more they fail when there is a sweeping change in the application. Each
                and every failed test needs to be checked to verify whether this is a

                  rel="noopener" target="_blank">Applitools Eyes</a>. Previous tools that tried to do this failed because comparing images pixel by pixel
                never works. For it to work, the tool needs AI algorithms to figure out what changes are not really changes
                and which ones are real.</p>
              <p name="ecf8" id="ecf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is how AI
                <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">today</strong> assists you in writing your test code, by writing all your checks for you. The human is still
                driving the tests, but the some of the checks are done automatically by the AI.</p>
              <p name="b9a3" id="b9a3"
                class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, the AI can check that a test passes, but when it fails it still needs to notify the human to check whether
                the failure is a real one, or happened because of a correct change in the software. The human will then have
                to confirm that the change is good, or reject it because it’s a bug.</p>
              <p name="2ebc" id="2ebc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And having the AI “see” the application means that the AI can check the
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">visual</em> aspects of an application against a baseline. This is something that until now could
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">only</em> be covered by manual testing.</p>
              <p name="d09e" id="d09e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the human still needs to assert every change.</p>
              <h3 name="5187" id="5187" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Level 2 — “Partial Automation”</h3>
              <p name="6f54" id="6f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">With Level 1 autonomy, the tester can pass on the tedious aspect of writing the checks for all the fields on
                a page onto the AI by having the AI test against a baseline. And the AI can now test the visual aspects of
                the page.</p>
              <p name="6784" id="6784" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But checking each and every test failure to verify whether it’s a “good” failure or a real bug can be tedious,
                especially if one change is reflected in many test failures. A Level 2 AI will assist the human in checking
                changes against the baseline and will turn what used to be a tedious effort into a simple one.</p>
              <p name="6710"
                id="6710" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Level 2 AI will look at the combination of DOM and screenshot to understand which parts of a page are dynamic
                and change based on data in the database or in external services, and which are static and are meant to be
                visual. Both of these aspects of a page, the dynamic and the static, need to be tested, but they need to
                be tested
                <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">differently</em> — the dynamic aspects are driven by the business logic, and the static pages are driven
                by the visual design.</p>
              <p name="188d" id="188d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If the AI can look at lots of snapshots of the same page, it can start to understand which parts of the page
                are dynamic, and which are static and treat them separately. The static parts can and should be understood
                visually, while the dynamic parts mostly need to be checked in terms of data.</p>
              <p name="3fca" id="3fca"
                class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once the AI can differentiate between the two, the alarms that it gives the human will not be just “this page
                has changed”, but “this data in the page should be the same, but isn’t”, versus “the page’s look has changed”.
                This will enable the human to check software changes more quickly.</p>
              <p name="3afc" id="3afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Moreover, because it has lots of snapshots of lots of pages, a Level 2 AI will be able to group lots of changes
                in lots of pages, changes that happened due to a correct software change, and tell the human that these are
                the “same” change, and would they like to please confirm or reject all these changes as a group.</p>

                <p name="b7e4" id="b7e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In Level 2, any failure or change detected in the software still needs to be vetted by a human. A Level 2
                  AI can help analyzing the change, but cannot understand whether a baseline is correct or not just by looking
                  at the baseline. But a Level 3 AI can do that and much more, because it can apply machine learning techniques
                  to both the data aspects of a page, and the visual aspects of a page.</p>

                  <figcaption class="imageCaption">A Level 3 AI will autonomously flag this as a bug</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p name="3265" id="3265" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For example, a Level 3 AI can look at the visual aspects of a page and figure out whether the design is off,
                  based on standard rules for design, rules like alignment rules, whitespace use, color and font usage, and
                  layout rules.</p>
                <p name="dd25" id="dd25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And what about the data aspects? A Level 3 AI will also be able to look at the data and figure out that all
                  the numbers up to now, in this field or that, need to be between a specific range, and that this field
                  is an email, and this one needs to be the sum of these fields above it. It can figure out that in this
                  page,
                  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this</em> table needs to be sorted by
                  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this </em>column.</p>
                <p name="4919" id="4919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So even if there was a change in the page, the AI can still understand that this page is OK, and not submit
                  it to a human to vet. And because that AI is looking at hundreds of test results, and seeing how things
                  change
                  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">over time</em>, it can apply machine learning techniques to detect
                  <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anomalies</em> in the changes, and only submit a test to a human to verify if such an anomaly is detected.</p>

                  <p name="c57d" id="c57d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Up to now, all the AI did was run the
                    <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">checks</em> automatically. The human is still driving the test, and clicking on the links (albeit using
                    automation software). Level 4 is where the AI is driving the test itself!</p>
                  <p name="b28b" id="b28b"
                    class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Level 4 AI will be able to understand some pages, by understanding what type of page it is. It will
                    understand that this page is a login page, this one is a profile page, and that one is a registration
                    page, or a shopping cart page. Once the AI understands the type of page, using techniques like reinforcement
                    learning, it can start driving the tests on it automatically, without human intervention.</p>
                  <p name="b33a"
                    id="b33a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But a Level 4 AI will be able to drive tests even on pages that it doesn’t understand, by looking at user
                    interactions over time, understanding them, and driving tests through this understanding.</p>

                  <p name="8f8f" id="8f8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">This one’s really Scifi, and we’re starting to fly on wings of fantasy. So fly with me: at this level,
                    the AI will be able to converse with the product manager, understand the application, and fully drive
                    the tests itself!</p>
                  <p name="91cd" id="91cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately, given that no human tester is capable of talking to a product manager to understand the
                    application, AI-s will need to be much smarter than humans to reach this level! 😀</p>

                    is much more complicated, as it entails understanding complex human interactions. An AI today doesn’t
                    <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">really</em> understand what it’s doing. It’s just automating tasks based on lots and lots of historical
